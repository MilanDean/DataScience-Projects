# DataScience-Projects
This is a compilation of small projects I developed related to data analytics and machine learning.
Please **Note**: This is a work in progress, and I will continually update the scripts I have added, as well as new ones as I program more.

# [911 Calls](https://github.com/MilanDean/DataScience-Projects/blob/master/DataCleaning911CallsCapstoneProject.ipynb)
My first capstone project, *ever*. This was completed as a requirement in order to continue to the second portion of my data science bootcamp, which focused solely on machine learning.
This small project highlights what I have learned about data cleaning, visualization, and problem solving in order to get the answers I'm looking for. 



# [Prediction of Diabetes](https://github.com/MilanDean/DataScience-Projects/blob/master/Prediction%20of%20Diabetes.ipynb)
After comparing the features against themselves, there seems to be low correlation between features and predicting the development of diabetes.
This is a script utilizing the Support Vector Machine (SVM) supervised learning algorithm in order to classify whether or not an individual will develop diabetes.
This also uses the PCA algorithm for dimensionality reduction, as a means of testing the SVM algorithm to determine the features that would output the highest accuracy when predicting the development of diabetes.
The dataset can be found on [here](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database) from Kaggle.com.


# [Titanic Survival Prediction using Regression Analysis](https://github.com/MilanDean/DataScience-Projects/blob/master/Data%20Cleaning%20and%20Titanic%20Survival%20Prediction.ipynb)
This famous [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic) from Kaggle was used for a binary classification competition, and a very commonly used dataset for beginner-level
machine learning use. Similarly to my 911 Calls dataset, this script highlights what I have learned about data cleaning, visualization, and logistic regression.
The most important part of this dataset to me was learning how to organize my data in a way that makes it easier to manipulate in order to gather information about the sinking of the Titanic.
